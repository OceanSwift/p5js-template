# p5js-template
Empty template for a p5js http://p5js.org/ project with ready to use html, css and js files. 

Expands a bit on the other empty project examples. Includes a reference to css class for the sketch, preload-setup-draw functions with some quick stuff to un-comment or delete in the script file.

The HTML file looks for the script source for the main sketch and for p5js at the root directory, and for the extra sound and DOM libraries one subdirectory below in a folder called “libraries”. Just edit the path if you have it set up otherwise. The HTML file also loads the webMIDI script from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webmidi , just delete it of course if you aren’t going to use it.npm/webmidi
