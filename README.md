# p5js-template
Empty template for a p5js http://p5js.org/ project with ready to use html, css and js files. 

The HTML file looks for the script source for the main sketch and for p5js at the root directory, and for the extra sound
and DOM libraries one subdirectory below in a folder called "libraries". Just edit the path if you have it set up otherwise.
